## Blocipedia

This app is designed with Git wikis in mind. In Blocipedia, you can create new wikis and edit public wikis. You can also use a ***real*** credit card with ***real*** money to upgrade to a premium account (while the site in production is being used). With premium, users can create private wikis, which are only visible to themselves, and members whom they invite to collaborate on the wiki. Wikis support markdown and will display correctly in the browswer.

The live site can be found [here](https://secret-cove-26230.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in)

Things you may want to cover:

### Ruby Version
This app definitely works with Ruy version 2.3.2 older versions were not tested.

### System Dependencies
Everything should run fine, given the gems included in the Gemfile. No special configuration needed.

### Database Creation
The database is seeded with random information from the gem `faker` in production and test. I've chosen Super Heroes as titles and Chuck Norris jokes as content.
